            <p>After leaving Texas, I chose to travel for a while before returning to finish my bachelors degree. 
                I went to DC for a couple of weeks to explore the amazement and history that lies within that city.
                Here are some of my photos of from that trip.

            <p>The two weeks I spent in DC were some were amazing. Finally I got to cross something off of my bucket list. </p>
